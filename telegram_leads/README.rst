 Telegram Leads
================

Generate Leads out of messages forwarded in Telegram.

The module contains necessary configuration and documenation, while AWS-Lambda
code is proprietary and provided only after purchasing the module `odoo apps
store <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/telegram_leads/>`__.

Roadmap
=======

* TODO: update user view
* TODO: UTM source is not used. It's required to update openapi module and add
  posibility to use predefined context in method calls (currently it's supported for creation only)
